      <div className="notice" style={{ margin: "18px 0" }}>
        <b>You are using an AI system.</b> Dossierly interprets and explains. It does not give legal or medical advice and does not act for you before any office.
      </div>

      <h2>Who runs Dossierly</h2>
      <p>Dossierly is operated by Gokul Nath, an individual. Contact: <a href="mailto:darthstormer.ai@gmail.com">darthstormer.ai@gmail.com</a>.</p>

      <h2>What the service does</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prepares checklists for appointments at Polish immigration offices from official public pages, with citations.</li>
        <li>Interprets a conversation between you and an official, both ways.</li>
        <li>Reads official letters, explains them, links them to your case, counts deadlines and drafts a Polish cover letter for you to check and send yourself.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What it does not do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It is not a lawyer, doctor or official interpreter (tłumacz przysięgły). Its output is not legal or medical advice.</li>
        <li>It can be wrong. Check every date, amount and document name against the original. The date written in your letter always takes precedence over our calculation.</li>
        <li>It does not submit anything to an office on your behalf.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you need advice about your case, find a qualified lawyer, for example through the Polish bar register:{" "}

      </p>

      <h2>Payments</h2>
      <p>
        Dossierly Plus is sold by our merchant of record, Dodo Payments, which handles payment, invoices and VAT. Prices are shown in US dollars; checkout shows your local currency.
        Dossierly Plus is a one-time payment that covers one residence case for 18 months and does not renew. The free plan includes three letters, appointment preparation and live interpreting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Withdrawal: as a consumer you normally have 14 days to withdraw from a digital service. Before checkout you are asked to confirm that you want access immediately and that you lose this right once the service starts. If something went wrong, write to us and we will look at it.
      </p>

      <h2>Fair use</h2>
      <p>Do not use Dossierly to harm others, to impersonate an official, or to process another person&apos;s data without their permission. We may limit requests to keep the service running for everyone.</p>

      <h2>Liability</h2>
      <p>We provide the service with care but cannot guarantee that every translation, explanation or calculation is correct. Nothing in these terms limits rights you have under Polish or EU consumer law.</p>
